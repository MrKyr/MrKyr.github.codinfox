### Code:

```sh
$ soxmix -v .5 a.wav -v -.5 b.wav acapella.wav
```

That's it. `a.wav` is the main, `b.wav` is the instrumental and `acapella.wav` is the output file.    
`-v .5` means half volume. `-v -.5` means half volume inverted.    
No gui, no muss, no fuss and can easily be batched or scripted.    
Only caveat, your instrumental and main must be lined up already.    
If it's not, the resulting file will be a MESS.
